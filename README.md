Vehicle Showroom Management System - Assignment 4 for CS 3330 (Object Oriented Programming) at the University of Missouri
Written in: Java

This repository consists of a Vehicle class and four subclasses that represent different types of vehicles. All data about the vehicles is stored in a csv file (located in the files directory). The VehicleManager class has several methods that allow the user to manage the content in the system. It is used to read in the inventory, display information, make changes such as adding, removing, and updating vehicles, and saving this information back to the csv file. The Main.java file provides a possible way one might use the classes and associated methods, as well as tests for each method. 

The purpose of this project was to practice reading in data from a csv file, creating subclasses, and to make use of concepts learned in class such as constructors, getters and setters, static fields, and the toString() method.
